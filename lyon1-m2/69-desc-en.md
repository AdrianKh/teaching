[Visualizations on CO2 emissions](https://dataviz-groupe69.github.io/CO2-Emission-Visualizations)

We have therefore chosen to work on CO2 emissions, and thus to respond to several issues. See that CO2 emissions have been constantly increasing since the industrial period and the most polluting countries by year / since a given year.We also wanted to check the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature increase, to see if there is a link between CO2 emissions and sea level rise..
