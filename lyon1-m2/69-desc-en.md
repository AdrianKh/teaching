# Visualizations on CO2 emissions

We have therefore chosen to work on CO2 emissions, and thus to respond to several issues:

* See that CO2 emissions have been constantly increasing since the industrial period
* See the most polluting countries by year / since a given year
* Verification of the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature increase.
* To see if there is a link between CO2 emissions and sea level rise
