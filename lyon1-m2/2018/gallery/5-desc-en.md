[Electric Vehicles versus Thermic Vehicles (EVsTV)](https://evstv.github.io/index.html)

This project aims to compare the environmental cost of the production of both
electric vehicles and ICEV (internal combustion engine vehicles, "voitures
thermiques" in french, hence the name of the project). The visualization has
been designed to be a decision support tool for future buyers, so we hope that
by using our work, people will have a better understanding of what lies behind
the production of each and make their choice accordingly.
