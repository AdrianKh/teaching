[Hurricanes Visualization](https://hurricane-viewer.github.io/)

### Application

This project proposes to visualize our planet's hurricanes evolution through time and space from 1842 to 2016.


- The main visualization is a world map on which we can see hurricanes trajectories after a selected year.
A slider below allows you to select the starting year.


- The second visualization is a line chart where multiple hurricanes selected on the map can be compared.

- The last visualization shows the distribution of the number of hurricanes over the years correlated with average temperature variations on Earth.
