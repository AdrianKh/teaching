# Project Description

This project consists of visualizations whose primary purpose is to describe the variation of average temperatures from 1750 to 2013 in the major cities of the world. The data provided for each city are: date, average temperature of each month, Latitude and Longitude. Attention was also paid to the different countries and the world in general. However, in order to bring a secondary interest to this work, we put the results obtained in relation with the variations of the rate of CO2 emission and the increase of the level of the sea over the years.

This study gives an overview of the climate change suffered by our planet but also allows to bring a dimension of awareness about the importance of this change on our way of life.
