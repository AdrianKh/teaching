Influence of weather events in the United States on the price of insurance. <br>
Project directed by Cheikh Toure, Rhizlaine Degni, Floriand Baud and Antoine Vendeville. <br>
This project aims to highlight the link between the damage caused by climate events in the US and the price of home insurance. We used a dataset that lists more than 50 000 climate events in the United States during the year 2017, with just over 50 different types of events (storm, tornado, ...). For each event we have the states that have been affected and the damage caused (in $). For each type of event, a map of the United States has been created where each state is colored according to the amount of damage caused by all such accumulated events. Next to it is a cloud of words: each state is represented with a size proportional to the price of home insurance in this state. We can observe the correspondence between the damage caused by climate events and the price of insurance in each state. In addition, we have also done a HeatMap which represents the frequency of different climatic events throughout the year. We observe the impact of the seasons on the types of events encountered.
